# Netsuite-Fraud-Address-Search
Searches and marks sales orders that could be potential fraud with approval needed

You just need to create a custom record for storing the fraudulent or suspected fradulent addresses and names. This is more or less reactive to fraud, but it does work. Likely you may never see the same address or name used more than once or twice, but this was asked to be written, so I'll share for any person having to endure working with Netsuite! :)
